  "readme": "Squire\n======\n\nSquire is an HTML5 rich text editor, which provides powerful cross-browser normalisation in a flexible lightweight package (only 16.5KB of JS after minification and gzip, with no dependencies!).\n\nIt was designed to handle email composition for the [FastMail](https://www.fastmail.com) web app. The most important consequence of this (and where Squire differs from most other modern rich text editors) is that it must handle arbitrary HTML, because it may be used to forward or quote emails from third-parties and must be able to preserve their HTML without breaking the formatting. This means that it can't use a more structured (but limited) internal data model (as most other modern HTML editors do) and the HTML remains the source-of-truth. The other consequence is excellent handling of multiple levels of blockquotes.\n\nSquire was designed to be integrated with your own UI framework, and so does not provide its own UI toolbar, widgets or overlays. Instead, you get a component you can insert in place of a `<textarea>` and manipulate programatically, allowing you to integrate seamlessly with the rest of your application and lose the bloat of having two UI toolkits loaded.\n\nSquire supports all reasonably recent, and even moderately old, browsers (even IE11, although this is not tested much these days).\n\nIn addition to its use at [FastMail](https://www.fastmail.com), is is also currently used in production at [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/), [Zoho Mail](https://www.zoho.com/mail/) and [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/), as well as other non-mail apps (drop me a line if you're using Squire elsewhere, I'm always interested to hear about it!).\n\nAn example UI integration can be tried at http://neilj.github.io/Squire/. Please note though, this is an out-of-date version of Squire and a slightly buggy implementation written by an intern many years ago. For a demo of the latest version with a production-level UI integration, [sign up for a free FastMail trial](https://www.fastmail.com/signup/) :). There's also a very bare-bones integration in the repo; just clone it and open `Demo.html`. If you are reporting a bug, please report the steps to reproduce using `Demo.html`, to make sure it's not a bug in your integration.\n\nInstallation and usage\n----------------------\n\n1. Copy the contents of the `build/` directory onto your server.\n2. Edit the `<style>` block in document.html to add the default styles you\n   would like the editor to use (or link to an external stylesheet).\n3. In your application, instead of a `<textarea>`, use an\n   `<iframe src=\"path/to/document.html\">`.\n4. In your JS, attach an event listener to the [`load` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/load) of the iframe. When\n   this fires you can grab a reference to the editor object through\n   `iframe.contentWindow.editor`.\n5. Use the API below with the `editor` object to set and get data and integrate\n   with your application or framework.\n\n### Using Squire without an iframe.\n\nSquire can also be used without an iframe for the document. To use it this way:\n\n1. Add a `<script>` tag to load in `build/squire.js` (or `squire-raw.js` for the debuggable unminified version).\n2. Get a reference to the DOM node in the document that you want to make into the rich textarea, e.g. `node = document.getElementById( 'editor-div' )`.\n3. Call `editor = new Squire( node )`. This will instantiate a new Squire instance. Please note, this will remove any current children of the node; you must use the `setHTML` command after initialising to set any content.\n\nYou can have multiple squire instances in a single page without issue. If you are using the editor as part of a long lived single-page app, be sure to call `editor.destroy()` once you have finished using an instance to ensure it doesn't leak resources.\n\n### Security\n\nMalicious HTML can be a source of XSS and other security issues. I highly recommended you use [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) with Squire to prevent these security issues. If DOMPurify is included in the page (with the standard global variable), Squire will automatically sanitise any HTML passed in via `setHTML` or `insertHTML` (which includes HTML the user pastes from the clipboard).\n\nYou can override this by setting properties on the config object (the second argument passed to the constructor, see below). The properties are:\n\n* **isSetHTMLSanitized**: `Boolean`\n  Should the HTML passed via calls to `setHTML` be passed to the sanitizer? If your app always sanitizes the HTML in some other way before calling this, you may wish to set this to `false` to avoid the overhead.\n* **isInsertedHTMLSanitized**: `Boolean` (defaults to `true`) – Should the HTML passed via calls to `insertHTML` be passed to the sanitizer? This includes when the user pastes from the clipboard. Since you cannot control what other apps put on the clipboard, it is highly recommended you do not set this to `false`.\n* **sanitizeToDOMFragment**: `(html: String, isPaste: Boolean, self: Squire) -> DOMFragment`\n  A custom sanitization function. This will be called instead of the default call to DOMPurify to sanitize the potentially dangerous HTML. It is passed three arguments: the first is the string of HTML, the second is a boolean indicating if this content has come from the clipboard, rather than an explicit call by your own code, the third is the squire instance. It must return a DOM Fragment node belonging to the same document as the editor's root node, with the contents being clean DOM nodes to set/insert.\n\nAdvanced usage\n--------------\n\nSquire provides an engine that handles the heavy work for you, making it easy to add extra features. With the `changeFormat` method you can easily add or remove any inline formatting you wish. And the `modifyBlocks` method can be used to make complicated block-level changes in a relatively easy manner.\n\nIf you load the library into a top-level document (rather than an iframe), or load it in an iframe without the `data-squireinit=\"true\"` attribute on its `<html>` element, it will not turn the page into an editable document, but will instead add a constructor named `Squire` to the global scope.\n\nYou can also require the NPM package [squire-rte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/squire-rte) to import `Squire` in a modular program without adding names to the global namespace.\n\nCall `new Squire( document )`, with the `document` from an iframe to instantiate multiple rich text areas on the same page efficiently. Note, for compatibility with all browsers (particularly Firefox), you MUST wait for the iframe's `onload` event to fire before instantiating Squire.\n\nIf you need more commands than in the simple API, I suggest you check out the source code (it's not very long), and see how a lot of the other API methods are implemented in terms of these two methods.\n\nThe general philosophy of Squire is to allow the browser to do as much as it can (which unfortunately is not very much), but take control anywhere it deviates from what is required, or there are significant cross-browser differences. As such, the [`document.execCommand`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand) method is not used at all; instead all formatting is done via custom functions, and certain keys, such as 'enter' and 'backspace' are handled by the editor.\n\n### Setting the default block style\n\nBy default, the editor will use a `<div>` for blank lines, as most users have been conditioned by Microsoft Word to expect <kbd>Enter</kbd> to act like pressing <kbd>return</kbd> on a typewriter. If you would like to use `<p>` tags (or anything else) for the default block type instead, you can pass a config object as the second parameter to the squire constructor. You can also\npass a set of attributes to apply to each default block:\n\n    var editor = new Squire( document, {\n        blockTag: 'P',\n        blockAttributes: { style: 'font-size: 16px;' }\n    })\n\nIf using the simple setup, call `editor.setConfig(…);` with your\nconfig object instead. Be sure to do this *before* calling `editor.setHTML()`.\n\n### Determining button state\n\nIf you are adding a UI to Squire, you'll probably want to show a button in different states depending on whether a particular style is active in the current selection or not. For example, a \"Bold\" button would be in a depressed state if the text under the cursor is already bold.\n\nThe efficient way to determine the state for most buttons is to monitor the \"pathChange\" event in the editor, and determine the state from the new path. If the selection goes across nodes, you will need to call the `hasFormat` method for each of your buttons to determine whether the styles are active. See the `getPath` and `hasFormat` documentation for more information.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nSquire is released under the MIT license. See LICENSE for full license.\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### addEventListener\n\nAttach an event listener to the editor. The handler can be either a function or an object with a `handleEvent` method. This function or method will be called whenever the event fires, with an event object as the sole argument. The following events may be observed:\n\n* **focus**: The editor gained focus.\n* **blur**: The editor lost focus\n* **keydown**: Standard [DOM keydown event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/keydown).\n* **keypress**: Standard [DOM keypress event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/keypress).\n* **keyup**: Standard [DOM keyup event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/keyup).\n* **input**: The user inserted, deleted or changed the style of some text; in other words, the result for `editor.getHTML()` will have changed.\n* **pathChange**: The path (see getPath documentation) to the cursor has changed. The new path is available as the `path` property on the event object.\n* **select**: The user selected some text.\n* **cursor**: The user cleared their selection or moved the cursor to a\n  different position.\n* **undoStateChange**: The availability of undo and/or redo has changed. The event object has two boolean properties, `canUndo` and `canRedo` to let you know the new state.\n* **willPaste**: The user is pasting content into the document. The content that will be inserted is available as either the `fragment` property on the event object, or the `text` property for plain text being inserted into a `<pre>`. You can modify this text/fragment in your event handler to change what will be pasted. You can also call the `preventDefault` on the event object to cancel the paste operation.\n\nThe method takes two arguments:\n\n* **type**: The event to listen for. e.g. 'focus'.\n* **handler**: The callback function to invoke\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### removeEventListener\n\nRemove an event listener attached via the addEventListener method.\n\nThe method takes two arguments:\n\n* **type**: The event type the handler was registered for.\n* **handler**: The handler to remove.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### setKeyHandler\n\nAdds or removes a keyboard shortcut. You can use this to override the default keyboard shortcuts (e.g. Ctrl-B for bold – see the bottom of KeyHandlers.js for the list).\n\nThis method takes two arguments:\n\n* **key**: The key to handle, including any modifiers in alphabetical order. e.g. `\"alt-ctrl-meta-shift-enter\"`\n* **fn**: The function to be called when this key is pressed, or `null` if removing a key handler. The function will be passed three arguments when called:\n  * **self**: A reference to the Squire instance.\n  * **event**: The key event object.\n  * **range**: A Range object representing the current selection.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### focus\n\nFocuses the editor.\n\nThe method takes no arguments.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### blur\n\nRemoves focus from the editor.\n\nThe method takes no arguments.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### getDocument\n\nReturns the `document` object of the editable area. May be useful to do transformations outside the realm of the API.\n\n### getHTML\n\nReturns the HTML value of the editor in its current state. This value is equivalent to the contents of the `<body>` tag and does not include any surrounding boilerplate.\n\n### setHTML\n\nSets the HTML value for the editor. The value supplied should not contain `<body>` tags or anything outside of that.\n\nThe method takes one argument:\n\n* **html**: The html to set.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### getSelectedText\n\nReturns the text currently selected in the editor.\n\n### insertImage\n\nInserts an image at the current cursor location.\n\nThe method takes two arguments:\n\n* **src**: The source path for the image.\n* **attributes**: (optional) An object containing other attributes to set on the `<img>` node. e.g. `{ class: 'class-name' }`. Any `src` attribute will be overwritten by the url given as the first argument.\n\nReturns a reference to the newly inserted image element.\n\n### insertHTML\n\nInserts an HTML fragment at the current cursor location, or replaces the selection if selected. The value supplied should not contain `<body>` tags or anything outside of that.\n\nThe method takes one argument:\n\n* **html**: The html to insert.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### getPath\n\nReturns the path through the DOM tree from the `<body>` element to the current current cursor position. This is a string consisting of the tag, id, class, font, and color names in CSS format. For example `BODY>BLOCKQUOTE>DIV#id>STRONG>SPAN.font[fontFamily=Arial,sans-serif]>EM`. If a selection has been made, so different parts of the selection may have different paths, the value will be `(selection)`. The path is useful for efficiently determining the current formatting for bold, italic, underline etc, and thus determining button state. If a selection has been made, you can has the `hasFormat` method instead to get the current state for the properties you care about.\n\n### getFontInfo\n\nReturns an object containing the active font family, size, colour and background colour for the the current cursor position, if any are set. The property names are respectively `family`, `size`, `color` and `backgroundColor`. It looks at style attributes to detect this, so will not detect `<FONT>` tags or non-inline styles. If a selection across multiple elements has been made, it will return an empty object.\n\n### createRange\n\nCreates a range in the document belonging to the editor. Takes 4 arguments, matching the [W3C Range properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Range) they set:\n\n* **startContainer**\n* **startOffset**\n* **endContainer** (optional; if not collapsed)\n* **endOffset** (optional; if not collapsed)\n\n### getCursorPosition\n\nReturns a bounding client rect (top/left/right/bottom properties relative to\nthe viewport) for the current selection/cursor.\n\n### getSelection\n\nReturns a [W3C Range object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Range) representing the current selection/cursor position.\n\n### setSelection\n\nChanges the current selection/cursor position.\n\nThe method takes one argument:\n\n* **range**: The [W3C Range object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Range) representing the desired selection.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### moveCursorToStart\n\nRemoves any current selection and moves the cursor to the very beginning of the\ndocument.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### moveCursorToEnd\n\nRemoves any current selection and moves the cursor to the very end of the\ndocument.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### saveUndoState\n\nSaves an undo checkpoint with the current editor state. Methods that modify the\nstate (e.g. bold/setHighlightColour/modifyBlocks) will automatically save undo\ncheckpoints; you only need this method if you want to modify the DOM outside of\none of these methods, and you want to save an undo checkpoint first.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### undo\n\nUndoes the most recent change.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### redo\n\nIf the user has just undone a change, this will reapply that change.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### hasFormat\n\nQueries the editor for whether a particular format is applied anywhere in the current selection.\n\nThe method takes two arguments:\n\n* **tag**: The tag of the format\n* **attributes**: (optional) Any attributes the format.\n\nReturns `true` if the entire selection is contained within an element with the specified tag and attributes, otherwise returns `false`.\n\n### bold\n\nMakes any non-bold currently selected text bold (by wrapping it in a `<b>` tag).\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### italic\n\nMakes any non-italic currently selected text italic (by wrapping it in an `<i>` tag).\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### underline\n\nMakes any non-underlined currently selected text underlined (by wrapping it in a `<u>` tag).\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### removeBold\n\nRemoves any bold formatting from the selected text.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### removeItalic\n\nRemoves any italic formatting from the selected text.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### removeUnderline\n\nRemoves any underline formatting from the selected text.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### makeLink\n\nMakes the currently selected text a link. If no text is selected, the URL or email will be inserted as text at the current cursor point and made into a link.\n\nThis method takes two arguments:\n\n* **url**: The url or email to link to.\n* **attributes**: (optional) An object containing other attributes to set on the `<a>` node. e.g. `{ target: '_blank' }`. Any `href` attribute will be overwritten by the url given as the first argument.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### removeLink\n\nRemoves any link that is currently at least partially selected.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### setFontFace\n\nSets the font face for the selected text.\n\nThis method takes one argument:\n\n* **font**: A comma-separated list of fonts (in order of preference) to set.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### setFontSize\n\nSets the font size for the selected text.\n\nThis method takes one argument:\n\n* **size**: A size to set. Any CSS [length value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) or [absolute-size value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_values_syntax#syntax-absolute-size) is accepted, e.g. '13px', or 'small'.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### setTextColour\n\nSets the colour of the selected text.\n\nThis method takes one argument:\n\n* **colour**: The colour to set. Any [CSS colour value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) is accepted, e.g. '#f00', or 'hsl(0,0,0)'.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### setHighlightColour\n\nSets the colour of the background of the selected text.\n\nThis method takes one argument:\n\n* **colour**: The colour to set. Any [CSS colour value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) is accepted, e.g. '#f00', or 'hsl(0,0,0)'.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### setTextAlignment\n\nSets the text alignment in all blocks at least partially contained by the selection.\n\nThis method takes one argument:\n\n* **alignment**: The direction to align to. Can be 'left', 'right', 'center' or 'justify'.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### setTextDirection\n\nSets the text direction in all blocks at least partially contained by the selection.\n\nThis method takes one argument:\n\n* **direction**: The text direction. Can be 'ltr' or 'rtl'.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### forEachBlock\n\nExecutes a function on each block in the current selection, or until the function returns a truthy value.\n\nThis method takes two arguments:\n\n* **fn** The function to execute on each block node at least partially contained in the current selection. The function will be called with the block node as the only argument.\n* **mutates** A boolean indicating whether your function may modify anything in the document in any way.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### modifyBlocks\n\nExtracts a portion of the DOM tree (up to the block boundaries of the current selection), modifies it and then reinserts it and merges the edges. See the code for examples if you're interested in using this function.\n\nThis method takes one argument:\n\n* **modify** The function to apply to the extracted DOM tree; gets a document fragment as a sole argument. `this` is bound to the Squire instance. Should return the node or fragment to be reinserted in the DOM.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### increaseQuoteLevel\n\nIncreases by 1 the quote level (number of `<blockquote>` tags wrapping) all blocks at least partially selected.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### decreaseQuoteLevel\n\nDecreases by 1 the quote level (number of `<blockquote>` tags wrapping) all blocks at least partially selected.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### makeUnorderedList\n\nChanges all at-least-partially selected blocks to be part of an unordered list.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### makeOrderedList\n\nChanges all at-least-partially selected blocks to be part of an ordered list.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### removeList\n\nChanges any at-least-partially selected blocks which are part of a list to no longer be part of a list.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### increaseListLevel\n\nIncreases by 1 the nesting level of any at-least-partially selected blocks which are part of a list.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### decreaseListLevel\n\nDecreases by 1 the nesting level of any at-least-partially selected blocks which are part of a list.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### code\n\nIf no selection, or selection across blocks, converts the block to a `<pre>` to format the text as fixed-width. If a selection within a single block is present, wraps that in `<code>` tags for inline formatting instead.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### removeCode\n\nIf inside a `<pre>`, converts that to the default block type instead. Otherwise, removes any `<code>` tags.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### toggleCode\n\nIf inside a `<pre>` or `<code>`, calls `removeCode()`, otherwise callse `code()`.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### removeAllFormatting\n\nRemoves all formatting from the selection. Block elements (list items, table cells, etc.) are kept as separate blocks.\n\nReturns self (the Squire instance).\n\n### changeFormat\n\nChange the **inline** formatting of the current selection. This is a high-level method which is used to implement the bold, italic etc. helper methods. THIS METHOD IS ONLY FOR USE WITH INLINE TAGS, NOT BLOCK TAGS. It takes 4 arguments:\n\n1. An object describing the formatting to add, or `null` if you only wish to remove formatting. If supplied, this object should have a `tag` property with the string name of the tag to wrap around the selected text (e.g. `\"STRONG\"`) and optionally an `attributes` property, consisting of an object of attributes to apply to the tag (e.g. `{\"class\": \"bold\"}`).\n2. An object describing the formatting to remove, in the same format as the object given to add formatting, or `null` if you only wish to add formatting.\n3. A Range object with the range to apply the formatting changes to (or `null`/omit to apply to current selection).\n4. A boolean (defaults to `false` if omitted). If `true`, any formatting nodes that cover at least part of the selected range will be removed entirely (so will potentially be removed from text outside the selected range as well). If `false`, the formatting nodes will continue to apply to any text outside the selection. This is useful, for example, when removing links. If any of the text in the selection is part of a link, the whole link is removed, rather than the link continuing to apply to bits of text outside the selection.\n\n### modifyDocument\n\nTakes in a function that can modify the document without the modifications being treated as input.\n\nThis is useful when the document needs to be changed programmatically, but those changes should not raise input events or modify the undo state.\n\n### linkRegExp\n\nThis is the regular expression used to automatically mark up links when inserting HTML or after pressing space. You can change it if you want to use a custom regular expression for detecting links, or set to `null` to turn off link detection.\n\n\n",
